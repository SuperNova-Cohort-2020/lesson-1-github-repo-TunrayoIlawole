    <p><strong>Remember The Titans.</strong>
    <br>
    I never thought i would enjoy a movie about American football till i watched <q>Remember the titans</q>. It resonated an important message, while being enjoyable at the same time.

    <p><strong>Guardians Of The Galaxy</strong>
    <br>
    I love <q>Guardians of the galaxy</q> because it had such really well written characters that seemed different from the conventional superhero movie characters. It was also hillarious, which was a bonus.

    <p><strong>Skyfall</strong>
    <br>
    <q>Skyfall</q> is by far the best James Bond movie ever made. It had a very good storyline and a the best written villain.
